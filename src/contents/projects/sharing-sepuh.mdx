## Introduction Sharing-Sepuh Project

Sharing-Sepuh is web app for discussing anything topic. On this platform, user can register, login, create thread for discuss, voting (up/down) the threads, comment the threads, voting (up/down) comments, and show leaderboards around user Sharing-Sepuh. This project has been implemented **Rich Text Editor** with `Tiptap/ReactJs`

### Impact For Me After Build Sharing-Sepuh Projects

- To exploring and deep learn about `NEXTJS + TypeScript` when after i learn this technology.
- Exploring `Redux Toolkit` more advance, e.g `Redux slices`, `Redux Thunk`, etc.
- Learning and exploring about how to implementation authentication system with `NextAuth`.
- Knowing and implementation architecture build frontend apps for separate UI between logical fetching data (`Redux Thunk`).
- Experiment and exploring technology for implementation Rich Text Editor with `Tiptap/ReactJS`.
- exploring validation form with `Zod` which is combined with `ReactHookForm`.

I was learning a lot about front-end web development while build this project, after i finish this
project, i think my programming skills are improved over time.
