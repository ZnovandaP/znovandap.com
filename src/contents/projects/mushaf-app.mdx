Project Mushaf App is a Muslim application, Mushaf App provide a complete Al-Quran with translate
(Bahasa), audio from professional Qory, included Quran interpretation, collection of daily prayers, 99 
Asmaul-Alhusna, and collection of tahlil prayers.

Project Mushaf App was build with one of modern technology front-end web development namely `ReactJS` 
combined with `TypeScript`. Mushaf App is my first time project which build on `React + TS`. There are 
some additional package dependencies for supporting this project. These include `Vite` for front-end 
module bundler, `ReactRouter` for routing, `ReactQuery` for fetching data, and `Material UI (MUI)` for 
building UI, Mushaf App has implemented `PWA` (Progressive Web Apps) technology. so has implemented 
PWA on this project has the advantage of a website being like a native application. Mushaf App build 
with `SPA` (Single Page Appliacation) architecture.

Main goals for building this project, including the following: 

- To exercise and implement `React + TypeScript` after i learn this technology.
- To exercise and deeping `Built in React Hook`
- Learning about how to build website UI Component Library with `Material UI`
