## Backstory Why Me Made This Project?

Project RakBukuKu is bookshelf app, this project is upgrade from project [Pojok Baca](/projects/pojok-baca).
Different from previous version. Project RakBukuKu was build with one of modern technology front-end
web development namely `ReactJS`. RakBukuKu is my first time project which build on `React`. There are
some additional package dependencies for supporting this project. These include `Vite` for front-end 
module bundler, `ReactRouter` for routing, `Redux` for state management, `TailwindCSS` for styling,
RakBukuKu has implemented `PWA` (Progressive Web Apps) technology. so has implemented PWA on this 
project has the advantage of a website being like a native application. RakBukuKu build with `SPA` 
(Single Page Appliacation) architecture.  

### Goals Build This Project

Main goals for building this project, including the following: 

- To exercise and implement `ReactJS` after i learn this technology.
- To exercise and implement `Built in React Hook`
- Learning about how to build website with `SPA` architecture with `ReactRouter`
- Learning about how to build website with `PWA` technology with `React + Vite`
- Learning about how to implement library for state management `React Redux`

I was learning a lot about front-end web development while build this project, after i finish this
project, i think my programming skills are improved over time.
